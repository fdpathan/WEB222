             <h3>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean? </h3>
             <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development technique that generates dynamic changes to the appearance
                of a website based on the screen size and orientation of the device used to view it.
                RWD uses breakpoints to determine how a site's layout will look: one design is used above a breakpoint, and another design is used below that breakpoint.
                The width of the browser is widely used to estimate breakpoints.
                Page elements reshuffle in responsive design as the viewport expands or contracts.
                A three-column desktop layout may be reduced to two columns for a tablet and one column for a smartphone. 
                To rearrange content and design elements, responsive design employs proportion-based grids.</p>

         <div class="question">
             <h3>How does responsive design relate to web technologies? </h3>
             <p>Responsive web design is important for a variety of reasons, the most important of which are user experience and site performance. 
                First, because the screen on a mobile phone or tablet is smaller than that of a standard desktop computer, it makes text and images easier to read/view.
                The internet became the most important source of information, and most people prefer to browse it to find various types of information.
                 As a result, having a strong online presence is critical for any business to thrive in this competitive market.
                 Following are the benefits to have responsive websites:
                Cost effectiveness
                Flexibility
                Improved user experience
                Search engine optimization gains
                Ease of management</p>

             <h3>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your
                research? </h3>
             <p>It is critical that you select an idea that piques your interest. Interest is essential for fueling motivation, which is essential when developing a web app. 
                It takes effort building web apps and it’s important you have fun during the process.
                Once we have chosen idea, its important to do market research.
                Then we need to decide the functionalities and features. The more features we include, the longer it will take to build your web app.
                Only define functionality which solves your target markets problems.
                We need to think  how our web app’s functionality will affect the overall design.
                Then we can build a prototype. We also saw how to store information in our database. After fully developing the frontend and backend we can host the webapp.</p>

             <h3>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course. </h3>
             <p>Throughtout this course, we learnt to approach when developing any custom application or software solution.
                We determined app requirements and created solutions accordingly.
                We learnt interactive web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) which stores and manipulates data.
                Our professor has explained us the purpose of www and http protocols.
                We learnt to develop small web applications using standards and best practices.
                It was interesting to implement JS in web client apps and using CSS to make our sites decorative and enhancing the appearance.
                Overall, this was the most interesting subject in this semester, as it is related to one's creativity.
                We can enjoy while creating and researching for creating websites,which helps us show our outlook, personality and creativity. </p>
